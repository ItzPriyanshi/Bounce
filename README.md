Bounce (Bun + Canvas) — Vercel ReadyA single-page Canvas animation of a bouncing ball inside a spinning neon ring. Optimized for high-DPI displays, uses delta-time physics, and runs entirely client-side. Minimal file setup:index.html•styles.css•index.js•package.json•README.md•FeaturesCanvas-based neon ring with glow and rotation•Realistic ball physics with collisions against a circular boundary•High-DPI scaling and desynchronized canvas context for smoother rendering•Pure client-side; no server runtime required•Quick StartClone and install (optional if you just open index.html)1.With Bun:•bun install◦With npm (only needed if you change the dev server):•npm install◦Run locally (dev server)2.Using Bun:•bun run dev◦Visit http://localhost:5173◦Open directly3.You can open index.html in a browser without any server.•Deploy on VercelThis is a static site. You can deploy as-is without a build step.•If you add an install step, commit bun.lockb (or bun.lock) for reproducible installs.•Recommended settings:•Framework preset: Other◦Build command: (leave empty)◦Output directory: .◦Install command: (none) for pure static, or bun install if you keep dev deps◦Project Structureindex.html: Minimal document with the canvas and module script•styles.css: Responsive sizing and background•index.js: Animation loop, neon ring rendering, and physics•package.json: Optional local dev server scripts•README.md: This file•Controls and BehaviorThe ring spins continuously; the ball collides with the inner edge of the ring.•Physics uses delta time, gravity, restitution, friction, and air drag.•Canvas scales to the viewport while remaining crisp on high-DPI screens.•CustomizationColors: Edit CSS variables in styles.css ( --neon1, --neon2, --neon3, --bg )•Spin speed: Change spin in index.js•Gravity and damping: Adjust g, rest, fAir in index.js•Ball size: Derived from canvas size; tweak the multiplier in init()•TroubleshootingAnimation looks blurry: Ensure devicePixelRatio scaling is active (default). Avoid browser zoom if possible.•Stutters on some devices: Close other intensive tabs; the canvas uses requestAnimationFrame. Try smaller canvas size by adjusting #c in styles.css.•Vercel deploy shows a directory listing: Ensure index.html is at the project root and no framework build is configured.•LicenseMIT (add a LICENSE file if needed)•
